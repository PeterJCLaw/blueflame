# BlueFlame

A match scheduler for [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org).

This is based on the mechanism applied to fix the output from the only
partially successful [match-scheduler2](https://github.com/PeterJCLaw/match-scheduler)
and discussions with [penelopezone](https://github.com/penelopezone) about
other ways to approach the problem.

# BlueFlame

A match scheduler for [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org).

This is based on the mechanism applied to fix the output from the only
partially successful [match-scheduler2](https://www.studentrobotics.org/cgit/comp/match-scheduler2.git)
and discussions with [samphippen](https://github.com/samphippen) about
other ways to approach the problem.
